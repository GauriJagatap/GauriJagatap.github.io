<p>
I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the Iowa State Univeristy (ISU), and I have been
working with <a target="_blank" href='http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/'> Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a> since August 2016.
</p> 

<p>My interests lie in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. For the past year, I have been working on 
developing algorithms for the sparse phase-retrieval problem. I also helped set-up 
the <a target="_blank" href='http://dsrg.stuorg.iastate.edu/'> Data Science Reading Group </a> at ISU. As a part of the student organization, I help
coordinate seminar sessions on some of the latest topics in data science. </p>
