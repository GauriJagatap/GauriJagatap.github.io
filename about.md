<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/prof.jpg" align="right"/> I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Iowa State Univeristy (ISU), and I have been
working with <a target="_blank" href='http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/'> Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a> since August 2016.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>My interests lie in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. For the past year, I have been working on 
developing algorithms for the sparse phase-retrieval problem. I also helped set-up 
the <a target="_blank" href='http://dsrg.stuorg.iastate.edu/'> Data Science Reading Group </a> at ISU. As a part of the student organization, I help
coordinate seminar sessions on some of the latest topics in data science. I also enjoy writing about about some of my pseudo-scientific musings on my blog called <a target="_blank" href='https://thecognitivevortex.wordpress.com/'> The Cognitive Vortex</a>. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am an alumnus of the BITS Pilani University (Goa), where I earned dual degrees in Physics (M.Sc.) and Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E.) in 2015.</p>
