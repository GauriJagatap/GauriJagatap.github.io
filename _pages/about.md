<p>I am a graduate student in the <a target="_blank" href='http://dice.ece.iastate.edu/'>DICE Lab</a> at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Iowa State Univeristy (ISU), and I have been working with <a target="_blank" href='http://home.engineering.iastate.edu/~chinmay/'>Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a> since August 2016. </p>

<p> My interests lie in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. During the course of my PhD so far, I have worked on phase retrieval, compressed sensing and regression problems in machine learning. I've been recently working on solving inverse imaging problems with deep image priors and developing provable algorithms for neural network compression. 

I also enjoy writing about about some of my pseudo-scientific musings on my blog called <a target="_blank" href='https://thecognitivevortex.wordpress.com/'>The Cognitive Vortex</a>.</p> 

<p> I am an alumnus of the BITS Pilani Goa, where I earned dual degrees in Physics (M.Sc.) and Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E.) in 2015.</p>
