<p>I recently joined Dolby Laboratories as a Deep Learning Researcher in the <a target="_blank" href='https://dolby.io/audio-research/'>Applied AI team</a>   in January 2022. Prior to this I graduated with my PhD from the <a target="_blank" href='http://dice.ece.iastate.edu/'>DICE Lab</a> at New York University under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href='https://chinmayhegde.github.io/'>Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a>, in December 2021. I have also interned at Google in 2021, Adobe in 2020 and MERL in 2018. I am an alumnus of BITS Pilani, Goa, where I earned dual degrees in Physics (M.Sc.) and Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E.) in 2015.</p>

<p> My interests lie in the intersection of signal processing, computer vision and deep learning. During the course of my PhD, I worked on several problems in inverse imaging, such as compressed sensing, phase retrieval and HDR imaging using deep neural networks. More recently I have been analyzing unrolled gradient based networks for inverse imaging problems. On the computer vision side, I have worked on developing algorithms to train adversarially robust neural networks. Concurrently I have also looked at new attack models to inspect vulnerabilities of vision based transformer architectures. </p>

<p> Outside of the topics that I explored during my PhD, I am also broadly interested in neural network model compression, designing deep learning based image and video compression models, generative networks and self-supervised learning. </p>

## Updates:
