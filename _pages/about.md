<p>I am a graduate student in the <a target="_blank" href='http://dice.ece.iastate.edu/'>DICE Lab</a> at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of New York University. Prior to this, I was a graduate student at Iowa State Univeristy (ISU), and I have been working with <a target="_blank" href='https://chinmayhegde.github.io/'>Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a> since August 2016. </p>

<p>I am also interning at Google Research this summer! Prior to this I have had the pleasure of interning at Adobe in 2020 and MERL in 2018.</p>

<p> My interests lie in the intersection of signal processing and machine learning. During the course of my PhD so far, I have worked on several problems in inverse imaging, such as compressed sensing, phase retrieval, HDR imaging and regression problems in machine learning. I have recently been working on solving inverse problems using deep neural networks as priors. Parallely, I have been working on developing algorithms to train adversarially robust neural network models. 

<p> I am an alumnus of the BITS Pilani Goa, where I earned dual degrees in Physics (M.Sc.) and Electrical and Electronics Engineering (B.E.) in 2015.</p>
