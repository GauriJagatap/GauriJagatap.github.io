<p>I am a Senior Researcher in the Multimodal Experiences Lab of the Advanced Tehnology Group at Dolby Laboratories in San Franscisco. Prior to this I graduated with my PhD from the <a target="_blank" href='http://dice.ece.iastate.edu/'>DICE Lab</a> at New York University under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href='https://chinmayhegde.github.io/'>Dr. Chinmay Hegde</a>, in 2022. I am an alumnus of Iowa State University and BITS Pilani, Goa, where I earned degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physics.</p>

<p> My current research interests and work at Dolby involves leveraging multimodal AI to improve video understanding for video processing applications. Previously I have also delved into topics in the intersection of signal processing, computer vision and deep learning.</p>
  
<p> During the course of my PhD, I worked on several problems in inverse imaging, such as compressed sensing, phase retrieval and HDR imaging using deep neural networks. On the computer vision side, I have worked on developing algorithms to train adversarially robust neural networks. Concurrently I have also looked at new attack models to inspect vulnerabilities of vision based transformer architectures. </p>
