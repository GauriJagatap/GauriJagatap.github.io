As a part of our summer mini-reading group seminar series, I presented a talk on 
<a target="_blank" href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08664>Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks</a> by Gilbert et. al.</p>

You can find the main points highlighted in the talk in these [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/CNNs.pdf) slides.
