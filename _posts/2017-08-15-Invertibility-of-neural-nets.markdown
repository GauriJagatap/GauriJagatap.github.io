As a part of our summer mini-reading group seminar series, I presented a talk on Towards Understanding the <a target="_blank" href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08664'> Invertibility </a> of Convolutional Neural Networks by Gilbert et. al.</p>

You can find the highlights of the talk in these [slides]({{ site.url }}/assets/CNNs.pdf).
