I happened to do two course projects in Spring 2017 on two allied problems: (i) Non-negative matrix factorization and (ii) Sparse PCA. While the problem formulation is different, both of them can be used in the context of extracting topics from a given database of documents.

In the following slides, I study and demonstrate some results in topic extraction and other applications using both of these formulations.
